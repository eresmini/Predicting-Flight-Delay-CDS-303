# CDS-303-Group-Project

Hey y'all! I know this isn't the most efficient way to go about our project, but at least we can try to be more collaborative, and be up to date on the advances/changes we're making! And, if we decide to do the live demo during our presentation, we can show the commit history here to Holly so everyone who coded can get their extra point.

The original code was made in Spyder. To avoid any issues with compiling, I strongly suggest you also work in Spyder, or something that you are certain is similar. As far as I'm aware, there is no 'easy' way to push code from Python enviroments to Github (unless some of y'all are Git Bash pros). Therefore, you'll need to copy and paste this code to your enviroment, and then copy and paste back to Github if you made changes. It's the best we've got right now...

PLEASE TRY TO FOLLOW THESE GUIDELINES!
- The code is broken into various cells; ONLY update the cells you changed! That way we all know what the most recent changes were and who made them
- if you change something, please add comments so we're all on the same page
- if you add a new cell, please add comments so we all know what the code does
- when you make a change, please consider shooting a message on Discord (under the 'project' channel) so everyone can work with the most updated version of the project

Happy coding :)
